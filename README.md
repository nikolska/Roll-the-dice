# Roll-the-dice

The application will simulate the throws of the dice and return the result.

The code of such a cube looks like xDy + z, where:
y - type of dice to use (e.g. D6, D10),
x - number of dice rolls; if we throw once, this parameter is negligible,
z - the number to be added (or subtracted) to the dice result (optional).

Dice types found in the games: D3, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100.

Enter the data for verification after "if __ name__ == '__ main__':" in the application.

To run the program, just open the "main.py" file in the console or open the "main.py" file in the IDE and press "run main".
